<h1>Lecture Notes - Human Rights by Andrew Clapham</h1>
<h2>Chapter 1 - Looking at Rights</h2>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>* Historically, human rights were defended because of religion, but should not be the 
  main argument
* What is human rights?
* 
* Why should we have rights
* Having rights allows us to perform our civic duties
* Sense of justice: we bond over crime
</pre></div>


<h2>Chapter 2 - The Historical Development of International Humans Rights</h2>
<h2>Chapter 3 - Human Rights Foreign Policy and the role of the United Nations</h2>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>* Reasons why we should want global human rights
* Creates a common sense of justice
* Why some people don&#39;t want their country to say a word on human rights
* Redefines country legislature: country should be able to control 
  whatever happen within their walls. When they have a word on what 
  other may do, it creates unecessary conflicts
* Human rights policies are different accross region. One country may
</pre></div>


<h2>Chapter 4 - The International Crime of Torture</h2>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>* Why we shouldn&#39;t allow torture:
* Information we get is unreliable because anyone will say anything to 
  stop the pain 
* Slippery Slope: we get so accustomed to torture that it becomes a norm 
  and we allow higher means of torture
* Allowing torture treats everyone as hostile rather than member of 
  society
</pre></div>


<h2>Chapter 5 - Legitimate Restrictions on freedom</h2>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>* When can the state take away our freedom:
* International Threats
* At what extends is collateral damage permitted:
* collateral damage is legal until the damage outweights the security
</pre></div>


<h2>Chapter 6 - Balancing Rights - The Issue of Privacy</h2>
<h2>Chapter 7 - Food, Education, health, housing and work</h2>
<h2>Chapter 8 - Discrimination and Equality</h2>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>* Discrimination: people in the same circonstance are treated differently
* What if the situation is so unique that there is no comparison, 
  can there still be discrimination?
* People who have committed crimes are treated &quot;less&quot; equals than a 
  crimeless person, but should be treated the same way as any criminal
</pre></div>


<h2>Chapter 9 - The Death Penalty</h2>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>* Human Rights should remain political:
* Human rights is about the relationship between individuals and 
  people in position of power, which is what politics is about
* Letting politicians make executive laws remains a good idea, because 
  they are democratically motivated: if they don&#39;t make good policies, 
  they won&#39;t get reelected; letting judges make these decisions isn&#39;t 
  as impactful because they will less consider outside perspective
