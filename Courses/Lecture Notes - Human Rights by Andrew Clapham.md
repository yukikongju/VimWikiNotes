## Chapter 8 - Discrimination and Equality
    * Discrimination: people in the same circonstance are treated differently
	* What if the situation is so unique that there is no comparison, 
	  can there still be discrimination?

## Conclusion
    * Human Rights should remain political:
	* Human rights is about the relationship between individuals and 
	  people in position of power, which is what politics is about
	* Letting politicians make executive laws remains a good idea, because 
	  they are democratically motivated: if they don't make good policies, 
	  they won't get reelected; letting judges make these decisions isn't 
	  as impactful because they will less consider outside perspective
