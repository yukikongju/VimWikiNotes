* [ ] [A DNA-Based Archival Storage System](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~luisceze/publications/dnastorage-asplos16.pdf)
    - DNA is a strong candidate for storing data stably for centuries. DNA also has a very high data/volume density (1 exabyte / mmÂ³).
    - This paper describes an algorithm for storing binary data in the form of DNA that is optimized for biochemical reactions.
