# IFT2125 - TP 1

## Overview 

This class was an introduction to python and to asymptotic notations using 
the definitions

## Question 1 - Write an algorithm for euclid algorithm and prove it 

### Euclid algorithm in python 

Euclid algorithm says: ``pgcd(a,b) = pgcd(b, a mod b)``

```python
def pgcd(a,b):
    while b != 0:
	a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```

### Proof for Euclid Algorithm

We prove it by contradiction.
1. Let d = pgcd(a,b) and d'=pgcd(b, a mod b) and assume that d!=d'
2. Since d != d', we have two cases: d<d' and d'<d
3. We can create a contradiction as follows: we show that d/d' is a common divisor 
   of a/b/(a mod b) using pgcd definition and we show that it is a contradiction 
   since d>d'

QUESTION: What argument do we use to show that d' divides (a mod b)

## Question 2 - Write an Algorithm for Bezout Identity (bonus: prove it)

Bezout Identity tells us that we can write the pgcd as a linear combination:
``pgcd(a,b) = sa+tb``

### Code for Bezout Identity (TO REVIEW)

We return s,t, pgcd(a,b)

```python
def pgcd_etendu(a,b):
    if b==0: # cas de base
	return (1,0,a)
    else:
	s1, t1, d = pgcd_etendu(b, a%b)
	s = t1
	t = s1 - (a//b)*t1
	return (s,t,d)
```

## Question 3 - Write a naive algorithm to calculate the determinant of a matrix (TO REVIEW)

We want to calculate the determinant of a matrix with a sum of cofactors matrices

````latex
\sum{}
````

In words:
1. choisir une ligne
2. for all cofactors matrices in column, sum it

```python 
def det(A):
    i,s = 0,0
    if len(A) == 1: # cas de base
	return A[0]0[0]
    else:
	for j in range(len(A)):
	    s += (-1)**(i+j) * A[i][j] * det(submatrix(A,i,j))
	return s

def submatrix(A,i,j):
    return [[A[x][y] for y in range(len(A)) if y!=j]]
    for x in range(len(A)) if x !=i]
```



## Question 4 - Prove Asymptotic Notation using the definitions

### Rappel - Definitions: Big O, Big Omega, Big Theta

- Big-O: \exists n_0 and c such that \forall n > n_0, we have f(n) <= c * g(n)
- Big-Omega: \exists n_0 and c such that \forall n > n_0, we have f(n) >= c * g(n)
- Big-Theta: f(n) \elem Big-O and Big-Omega

### Examples 

#### Polynomial and exponential functions

Use definitions: fix n_0 and c

#### Sin, cos, ..

Remember that:
- -1 <= sin(x) <= 1
- -1 <= cos (x) <= 1

Find n_0 and c
