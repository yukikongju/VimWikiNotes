<h1>Why niche branches in academia is a ponzi scheme</h1>
<p>In academia, there are fields of studies that are only there for the prestige. Having a degree in women studies or in anthropology doesn't translate in the job market. It actually doesn't give you any skillset.</p>
<p>The only way you can get a job in that field is to become a professor. Thus, to get a job, you have to recruit students and convince them that your field of study is important.</p>
