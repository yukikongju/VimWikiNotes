<h1>Women Studies is not a science</h1>
<p>In science, to determine wether a theory is true or not, we follow what is called the <a href="scientific method.html">scientific method</a>. We first hypothesize on a potential explanation, observe the results and tweak our hypothesis based on our new findings.</p>
<p>However, women studies doesn't work that way: the course usually begins with a given conclusion, and every fact presented is interpreted to fit that narative.</p>
