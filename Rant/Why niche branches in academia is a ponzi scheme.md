# Why niche branches in academia is a ponzi scheme

In academia, there are fields of studies that are only there for the prestige. Having a degree in women studies or in anthropology doesn't translate in the job market. It actually doesn't give you any skillset.

The only way you can get a job in that field is to become a professor. Thus, to get a job, you have to recruit students and convince them that your field of study is important.
