# On Communicating better

I want to improve my communication skills as a writer and as a communicator. Consequently, I want to:
- write more
- Be more eloquent whenever I talk 

## Mindset for writing more

### Why write more

I want to write more because it helps me explain myself better. I have two goals:
- be more precise and concise in my speech
- develop a better vocabulary

### What to write about

Jeje told me that I could journal what I have done that day or my current
thoughts and where about, but honestly, I am not really interested in that,
because I do that already. Instead, I would like to better my skills as a
"journalist". I would like to write small essay about my thoughts and my opinions
on diverse stuffs.

### How to write journalistic pieces

I have a few ideas on what to write about. However, I feel like my thoughts
process is a bit scattered. I have difficulty presenting my points in a
sequential way. Also, since I often write about my opinions, I do not use
statistics and real facts/evidence to support my claims. Everything I do is
kind of hypothetical and based on my own experience, which is not what
journalism is about.

- Research:
- Plan:

## On being more eloquent

In a 1-1 environment, I think I make my interlocutor feel at ease (when meating new people for example). However, whenever the conversation takes a more "debate-like" turn, I feel like I can come accross rude and rigid, because I unconsciously want to make myself smarter than I actually am.

Of course, whenever I talk to someone about big stuffs, I want to sound smart, but it often goes against my natural charisma. I thrive whenever I can get people to talk about themselves and entertain a conversation. However, when the conversation turns somewhat political, there are times when I can lose my cool.

There are a few instance where I want to make myself talk more clearly:
- Explaining Stuffs: coaching, programming, mentoring, ...
- Opinions: Ranting, debating, ...

To express my opinions in a clearer way, I want to write opinions essay about random subjects I think are quite interesting (in my Rant section in vimwiki). As for the explaining stuffs, I am not sure how I will achieve that goal. For once, I can practice myself when coaching, but these kids already have a context. I want to be able to explain programming and maths concepts to the general population with no prior knowledge on the subjects.
