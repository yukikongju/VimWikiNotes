# Principles of Bullet Journaling

There are several use for bullet journaling:

- daily tasks
- yearly, quarter, monthly and weekly review
- habit tracking
- gratitude

I want to use my bullet journal mainly for the first 3 goals: (1) daily tasks; 
(2) reviews (3) habit tracking

I also want to include active recall into my journal
