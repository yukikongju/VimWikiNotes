# Making a cheatsheet during class

I have seen the best students swore by cheatsheet. But what I didn't see 
is how they made their cheatsheet. Most of them made them two ways:

- Whilst doing exercices: they note definitions, theorems and tricks they 
  used to solve the problems
- After doing all exercices: they go back to the exercices and theory they 
  have done 

However, I found that making my cheat sheet during class (yes, during!) 
allowed me to save up time when it came to studying. I mostly write chapter 
and their subsections and the questions we wanted to answer. This linear 
way of thinking is a good way to see quickly all the materials that has 
been taught over the semester, and see what is lacking.

I also make another cheatsheet, that follows a more frestyle thinking, as I 
don't go through the course content linearly. I try to regroup everything 
the way I understand it.

This cheatsheet also allows me to go back to big ideas quickly.
