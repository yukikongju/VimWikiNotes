I have used vimwiki last year, but I didn't keep a good structure, so I stopped using it. This session, I want to keep my lecture reviews and my notes in here instead of in OneNote.

I also want this section to show how I structure my thoughts.

To dos:
- [ ] Explore Computer Graphics
- [ ] Use requests_html ``HTML_Session.render()`` to get html generated by js
- [ ] Finish audl API
