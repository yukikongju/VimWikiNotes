# Non-Linear Approach to Learning

## Why linear learning is not optimal

This semester, I used pandoc to generate a document to review what was 
seen during class. However, this technique wasn't good because I was 
suffering from Duning-Kruger. Because I could recognize the big outline, 
I tought I understood the concept when I didn't.

Also, linear learning isn't good to build up new knowledge and to see the big 
picture because it is much harder to see the links between subjects

## Using Mind Map to flesh out big picture stuffs

I think I didn't perform well for my exams because I spend too much time on 
the big picture rather than spending time on individual concept and then 
putting them in the big picture.

I find that it is better to spit out the course content in a non-linear way 
(ie make a map of how concepts intertwine) and then try to go deeper in 
each subject

## Reviewing the contents

The concept map should be reviewed frequently
