# Zettelkasten Note Taking Methods

The Zettelkasten Note Taking Methods State that we should keep track of 
3 types of notes:

1. Fleeting Notes: Spontaneous Notes
2. Literature Notes: Concepts from Reading
3. Permanent Notes: Concept that seems to stick when we review our fleeting and 
   litterature notes

Presently, I like to keep my fleeting notes in my pink notebook, but I 
would like to have to create a notetaking systems for everything I read.
