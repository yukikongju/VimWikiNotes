# A Review of my studying techniques

## Learning as a paradigm

I think that learning comes into three big steps:
- Processing: Understand the content of what is taught
- Recalling: Remember what has been taught
- Condensing: Reformulate what has been taught in a few keys concepts

I think that last session, I was too focussed on the recalling part. 
Consequently, I didn't have a good grasp on how stuffs worked on a nitty 
gritty level. Also, when I did the exercices, I didn't take the time to 
recall the techniques I used.

This session, I want to focus more on using the theorems to solve problems 
rather than recall the course and why it was presented that way. I found that 
following the lecture with the lecture notes side by side really helped 
for the classes where the teacher provided the notes. I also found 
that going through my notes several times and rewritting them in my own 
words, each time more distilled, made remember everything more.

I think that once the processing has been done right, the recalling part is 
a lot easier. Therefore, I really need to be thorough during class. By keeping 
track of what we have learned priors, I found that I was able to follow better 
in class.

Bref, my study tips are the following:

- Check out the problem set and the lectures notes beforehand (5 min before 
  class is okay)
- Write your own notes during class, but have the lecture notes open in front 
  of you 
- After class, rewrite what you have learn in your OWN words. Don't copy
- At the end of the day, write the big outline of each class, and circle the 
  concept you didn't understand to come back to them later.
- In my bullet journal, keep a sections with all of my questions that I 
  don't know the answer to 
- Keep a cheat sheet with all the formulas
- Keep track of the result in your exercices and how you solved them
