## Review of the Day

Today, I almost completed the webinar HackadayU: AVR. I learned how to write assembly code in arduino and explore some hardware materials that I haven't worked with before (MAX7219, speaker)

## Plan for Tomorrow

- [ ] Write Simon Says in Assembly
- [ ] Explore MAX7219 - Message Player
- [ ] Pong in Assembly and Arduino
- [ ] Write Outline for Previous Course

## Fact of the day
