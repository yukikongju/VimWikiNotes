# Processing, Encoding, Retrieving (incomplet)

Learning has 3 phases:

1. Processing: Learning new information
2. Encoding: transfer information from short-term memory to long-term memory
3. Retrieving: recall the information without any clues

**Processing**

- How can we learn new subjects in a way that requires the least brain power
- How can we understand a subject quickly?
- What methods consumes the most/least brain power? What is its encoding/
  retrieving factor?
  + Use Immersive Reader
  + Reformulate ideas
  + Recursive Learning: Big picture first and details later

**Encoding (what)**

- How can we maximise consolidation?

**Retention**




**Retrieving**

- How can remember information?

  + Using spaced repetition and active recall

### Three Types of Memory: short-term, long-term, working memory

There are three types of memory:

- short-term: RAM
- long-term: ROM
- working memory: registers

Our goals is to 

(1) store new information ( short-term memory to long-term memory )
(2) retrieve information ( long-term memory to short-term memory )
