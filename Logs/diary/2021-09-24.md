# An update on my study habits: more testing, focus on weakness

## The Study paradigm

The study paradigm looks a little like this:
* putting stuffs in your brain
* getting stuffs out of your brain 
* testing stuffs that you know

The last part is the thing I didn't do enough

## Current state of study

Currently, my study habits looks like this. At the end of each classes, 
I try to write out everything I remember from memory. I found that technique 
helpful to understand large concept, this strategy has two majors downside:
1. It takes a lot of times: I usually spend 20-30 min after each lecture
2. I don't spend enough time recalling stuffs I have seen and testing myself

Therefore, I want to try out another strategy using pandoc

## Introducing pandoc 

Recently, I found pandoc, which is a document compiler that can be used to 
convert one markdown file to pdf file (and more ..). My goal is the following:
1. At the end of each class, make an outline of everything we have done: 
   the theory we saw, the example we did, the remark, ... However, everythin 
   wrote out shouldn't be rewritten: that's what notes are for. Therefore, 
   I have to write out better notes
2. Since I won't spend so much time typing out full sentences, I will have more 
   time to test myself out and for active recall:
   - Testing: testing myself out means that I do exercice. Typically, I want to 
     redo all the example we did in class to make sure I get the same result 
     (since we have the correct answer)
   - Active Recall: For me, active recall means 3 things:
       - Active Recall for the nitty details: using the outline I have written 
	 out for each lectures, try to go over them and explain to myself what 
	 they were about. If I fail on those, add it to review list to review 
	 the concept and work a problem out
       - Active recall for concept overview: having a too narrow view on each 
	 lectures can sometimes be detrimental. Consequently, I want to introduce 
	 the "chapter summary" section in my pandoc file. Basically, I have 
	 to write everything out from memory, without looking at the lecture 
	 outline
       - Active Recall for demonstrations and exercices: Using "/exercice" 
	 and scrolling thorugh them, I can see the problem we did in class. 
	 I don't necessarily want to redo all the work, but I want to be able 
	 to recall the main idea of the proof. Only if I feel like I am missing 
	 something out will I do the problem 

## Things to get better at

- [ ] Cleaner lecture Notes: Since I am not using my vimwiki notes for reviewing, 
      only for recalling information, my lecture notes are the only thing I 
      have. I need to use more color and to write better 
- [ ] Scheduling time for active recall and redoing demonstrations
- [ ] Managing my TODOs: currently, I only work out my todos daily using vimwiki 
      dairy. However, I find that I don't keep track of everything I have to do 
      and that there is no priority. Maybe I should keep another pandoc file for 
      that
- [ ] Schedule time for logs
