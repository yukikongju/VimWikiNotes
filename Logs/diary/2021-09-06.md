# An Outlook on Connection

## Talking to strangers is more comfortable than with circumstantial friends

I feel like we can talk to strangers about anything because you don't have to
think about outside judgements. Yesterday, I went to Andrea's party and I felt
so much more comfortable sharing with people I didn't know than with people I
knew for several years.

I think that the friends you make in preschool and high school are circumstantial
friends: they are people you can have fun with, but they are not people you
usually share your ambitions and soul searching stuffs with.

Somehow, once someone has been a circumstantial friends for a while, it is
really hard to turn that friendship into a deeper connection. Honestly, I
feel like you have to bond early to be able to share deeper stuffs because
if you wait for awhile, there is an unspoken tension where no one wants to
share hardships.

## Why can't we have more than small talk with circumstantial friends

Being part of a group is not enough to share a deeper bond, but there are a few
ways to bond with people: alcohol and trauma. Obviously, one doesn't want to
set up a situation where you have to feel trauma. Therefore, alcohol always
seems like an obvious choice. However, sometimes, we can't use alcohol to bond
with people.

And I still haven't found a way to create that bond without it...
