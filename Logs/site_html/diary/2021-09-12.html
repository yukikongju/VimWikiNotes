<h1>Thoughts on PUA</h1>
<h2>Getting started on PUA early</h2>
<p>I saw <a href="https://youtu.be/zkdGsOKaDY4">Derrick's video</a> on PUA, the period in 
your life when it's all about picking up girls and going to parties. He
argued that most guys wanted to wait until they had their success to chase 
girls, but that tought process was flawed because you would associate your 
self-worth with your money, not what you are actually made of.</p>
<p>Even though he talked mostly about boys, I kind of felt compelled in what he 
said: you get most of your self worth by getting out of your comfort zone 
(ie talking to girls). </p>
<h2>Feeling left out on PUA culture</h2>
<p>Most of my life, I kind of felt left out of that hookup culture. I've never 
really had one night stand or gone out on dates regularly. Honestly, I have 
always felt out of place at parties where people are only there to smash and not 
getting to know each other.</p>
<p>I know that in most of social situations, I have great social skills to entertain 
a conversation, but whenever someone else tries to take the next step, I don't 
really pursue any potential relationship there. Maybe I self sabotage because 
I think that there are low chances that relationship might work out in the end;
maybe I am too insecure to get rejected; or maybee I don't like myself enough to 
think I am worthy of having a relationship on anyone. Nonetheless, whenever any
conversation steers away from friendship, I never make any moves even we both 
flirts, which is a problem.</p>
<h2>Am I good enough</h2>
<p>A part of me thoughts I was okay, but honestly, I don't really think I am. 
For the most part, being by myself was okay, but whenever I am at gather rounds, 
it always feels like I am missing out. I think I miss sharing a special 
friendship with someone and it hurts.</p>
<p>It sucks, because it is not like I had no opportunities to form special bonds. 
I met some special people (Dab, Ada, Frank, Dave) but I never took 
the time to develop anything more than that. Maybe because I never felt the same 
"click" that I did with Ely.</p>
