<h1>Aug 26, 2021</h1>
<p>I have decided to spend my meals watching educational Youtube Videos instead of watching Netflix. However, it is okay if I don't take notes. The goal is only to prime myself to be in the learning mode.</p>
<p>Currently, I am watching:
- Economics Explained
- 8-bit Music Theory
- Extra Credits</p>
<h2>Concept of the day: Strategy of Voting Theory</h2>
<p>In strategy of voting theory, we must define actors behaviors based on two axioms:
- Extension axiom: we must choose which we prefer: A,B or indiferent
- Transitivity Axiom: If we prefer B more than A and B more than C, we must prefer C more than A. This axiom prevent us from being stuck in a loop when trying to break a tie.</p>
<p>Ultimately, strategy of voting theory is to decide what course of action society should take in order to satisfy the most people. To do so, we create a simulation where each day, one person is drawn at random and act as the dictator. This person's preference will be society's for the day, and we compile which action we take in the course of n days. Of course, because we are social animals, we affect each others' behavior. Consequently, we want to define a social preference functions. This function must follow the non-randomness axiom: the should be a choice that primes all the others.</p>
