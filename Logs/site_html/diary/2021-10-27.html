<h1>Non-Linear Approach to Learning</h1>
<h2>Why linear learning is not optimal</h2>
<p>This semester, I used pandoc to generate a document to review what was 
seen during class. However, this technique wasn't good because I was 
suffering from Duning-Kruger. Because I could recognize the big outline, 
I tought I understood the concept when I didn't.</p>
<p>Also, linear learning isn't good to build up new knowledge and to see the big 
picture because it is much harder to see the links between subjects</p>
<h2>Using Mind Map to flesh out big picture stuffs</h2>
<p>I think I didn't perform well for my exams because I spend too much time on 
the big picture rather than spending time on individual concept and then 
putting them in the big picture.</p>
<p>I find that it is better to spit out the course content in a non-linear way 
(ie make a map of how concepts intertwine) and then try to go deeper in 
each subject</p>
<h2>Using the margin to write out class outline</h2>
<h2>Reviewing the contents</h2>
<p>The concept map should be reviewed frequently</p>
