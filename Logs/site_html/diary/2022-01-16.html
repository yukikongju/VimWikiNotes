<h1>Zettelkasten Note Taking Methods</h1>
<p>The Zettelkasten Note Taking Methods State that we should keep track of 
3 types of notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fleeting Notes: Spontaneous Notes</li>
<li>Literature Notes: Concepts from Reading</li>
<li>Permanent Notes: Concept that seems to stick when we review our fleeting and 
   litterature notes</li>
</ol>
<p>Presently, I like to keep my fleeting notes in my pink notebook, but I 
would like to have to create a notetaking systems for everything I read.</p>
