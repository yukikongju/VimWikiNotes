# Getting started with Vim

## A motivation for learning Vim

When I first learned how to code, an IDE was all that I used to compile my code.
However, as I became more familiar with the command line, I have found myself 
gravitating toward Vim. 

There are a few reasons that motivate my switch from IDE to Vim:  

1. Lighter Memory: Vim is about takes about 30x less memory than an IDE, 
   which makes coding more enjoyable if you work with a slow computer  
2. Editing Speed: vim allows you to edit your work faster as you don't need 
   your mouse to move around your screen.   
3. Customizable: One can mold your vim to fit your need. Customization can 
   be done inside the vimrc file

## Barriers of entry when switching from an IDE to Vim

Although there are legitimate reasons why people may want to stick to their IDE, 
in my experience, the most common reasons why people are relunctant to 
make the switch from IDE to Vim is for the following reasons:  

1. Learning curve: one can expect a few weeks to get familiar with the 
   vim workflow before getting faster than an IDE  
2. Setup: customization can be harder than on an IDE, so a few functionalities 
   found in an IDE may be missing in their Vim  

Regarding the former point, there are a few guide to learn how to use Vim. 
Personnally, I would recommend the following tutorials:

Here is a list of a few skills to know:  

- switch from insert mode to normal mode to visual mode  
- moving around the screen with hjkl, gg, G   

## Setting up pluggin managers

The .vimrc file is where you can customize your Vim editor to enhance your 
editing experience. Depending on what you are looking for, there exists some 
open-source pluggins that may perform what you are looking for.

Therefore, the first step is to download a pluggin manager. I use [Vim Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

## Setting up your first vimrc

I have found that I want my Vim editor to have the following functionalities:  

- File navigator: NERDTree, fzf, Startify  
- Compile Code:  
- Autocompletion: coc.nvim  
- Git Integration:  
- Debugger: vimspector  
- Snippets:  
- Colorscheme: gruvbox
